# 2D Grid Based Fluid Similulation
Based Joe Stam's paper "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games".

## Description

A simple way to animate visually accurate fuild dynamics. Based on grid, no particles involved. Only works for square matrix.

## Implementation

Simply include SFML files and library, copy the source code to local. and then build.

## Reference
